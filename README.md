# ðŸŽ® Hi, Iâ€™m Roman

Self-taught game developer just starting my journey in **Unity** and **C#**.  
My background is actually in architecture, but Iâ€™ve always loved games â€” so Iâ€™m learning how to build small 2D projects from scratch.

Currently working on my first playable demo â€” a simple pixel-art platformer with basic physics and funny sound effects.  
Next goal: learn how to publish a build and share it with friends!

Any tips from the community are always welcome ðŸš€
